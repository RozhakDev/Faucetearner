![Faucetearner Banner](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22af88b8-7b2c-41ec-bccb-b9ad2f7bcccb)

> An efficient and professional command-line tool for automatically claiming XRP tokens from Faucetearner.org.

This project is a complete refactor of the original Faucetearner script, rebuilt from the ground up with modern industry standards. It leverages asynchronous programming for high efficiency, object-oriented principles for clean and maintainable code, and professional logging for clear, structured output.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Professional & Clean Code**: Refactored into a well-structured, object-oriented architecture that is easy to read, maintain, and extend.
- **Asynchronous Core**: Built with `asyncio` and `aiohttp` for non-blocking operations, ensuring minimal resource consumption while waiting.
- **Standard CLI Interface**: Uses Python's `argparse` for straightforward command-line argument handling.
- **Reliable & Robust**: Includes proper error handling and session management to ensure stable, long-running operation.
- **Minimal Dependencies**: Only requires `aiohttp`, keeping the setup lightweight and simple.
